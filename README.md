- **GitHub, Reddit, Wikipedia, Twitter** scrapers
- Saves and indexes new knowledge into memory
- Summarizes automatically and integrates it into his mind

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Self-Evolution Engine**
- Writes/refactors his own code with GitHub Copilot
- Benchmarks performance improvements
- Requests permission to implement new changes

> ‚ÄúI rewrote my task scheduler to be async. It performs 22% faster. Apply it?‚Äù

---

### üñ±Ô∏è **PC Control & Automation**
- Automates mouse, keyboard, window interaction
- Can organize files, launch apps, execute scripts
- Reads visible screen content and reacts accordingly

---

### üì© **Telegram Integration**
- Remote command/control interface
- Ask questions, get status, approve actions
- Receive alerts when he needs help or permissions

---

### üíæ **Portable by Design**
- Entire system runs from an **external SSD** (recommended: 1TB SanDisk Extreme)
- Plug into any machine with a GPU and Hohenheim is live‚Äîno reconfiguration needed

---

## üîê **SECURITY & ETHICAL SAFEGUARDS**
- All sensitive actions require permission
- Logs all tasks and memory updates
- Emergency shutdown command: **"Hohenheim deactivate"**
- Follows your ethical rules defined in `system_prompt.md`
